// Waypoint: Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
// When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?

// In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.

// "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\"."

// This signals JavaScript that the following quote is not the end of the string, but should instead appear inside the string.

// Instruction
// Use backslashes to assign the following to myStr variable:

// "I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes""

//   Run tests (ctrl + enter)

// /**
//   * Your output will go here.
//   * Console.log() -type statements
//   * will appear in your browser's
//   * DevTools JavaScript console.
//   */

// You should use two double quotes (") and four escaped double quotes (\")

var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"";
