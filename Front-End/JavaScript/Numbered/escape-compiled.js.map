What happens when you need a literal quote: \" or ' inside of your string?\n\n// In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\\) in front of the quote.\n\n// \"Alan said, \\\"Peter is learning JavaScript\\\".\"\n\n// This signals JavaScript that the following quote is not the end of the string, but should instead appear inside the string.\n\n// Instruction\n// Use backslashes to assign the following to myStr variable:\n\n// \"I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"\"\n\n//   Run tests (ctrl + enter)\n//   Reset\t  Help\t  Bug\n\n// /**\n//   * Your output will go here.\n//   * Console.log() -type statements\n//   * will appear in your browser's\n//   * DevTools JavaScript console.\n//   */\n\n// You should use two double quotes (\") and four escaped double quotes (\\\")\n\nvar myStr = \"I am a \\\"double quoted\\\" string inside \\\"double quotes\\\"\";\n"]}
