// Waypoint: Split Strings with split
// You can use the split method to split a string into an array.

// split uses the argument you pass in as a delimiter to determine which points the string should be split at.

// Here is an example of split being used to split an array at every s character:

// var array = string.split('s');

// Use split to create an array of words from string and assign it to array.

var string = "Split me into an array";

// Only change code below this line.

var array = string.split(" ");

// Only change code above this line.

(function () {
  return array;
})();
